/*
How the allocator works:
- There are two AVL trees, one for free pages and one for all pages.

Free pages AVL tree:
- The key is the size of the regions.
- The value is a doubly linked list of starting addresses of the regions.

All pages AVL tree:
- The key is the starting address of the region.
- The value is the size of the region and 2 flags, one indicating if the region is reserved, and the other indicating if the region is free.

Allocation:
- When a region is allocated, the allocator searches for a region that is big enough in the free pages AVL tree.
- If the region is bigger than the requested size, the allocator splits the region into two parts.
- The first part is used to satisfy the request and the second part is added to the free pages AVL tree.
- The region is split accordingly in the all pages AVL tree, with the first part being updated to be used and the second part being added as a new node.

Allocation with a specific address:
- When a region is allocated with a specific address, the allocator searches for the region in the all pages AVL tree.
- If the region is found, the allocator marks the region as used in the all pages AVL tree and splits in accordingly.
- The region is removed from the free pages AVL tree.

Deallocation:
- When a region is deallocated, the allocator searches for the region in the all pages AVL tree.
- If the region is found, the allocator marks the region as free in the all pages AVL tree, and merges it with surrounding free blocks.
- The free pages AVL tree is updated accordingly.
